## P4

a. The sum is 11000001, so the complement is 00111110.

b. The sum is 01000000, so the complement is 10111111.

c. 01010100;	01101101.

## P5

   No, the receiver cannot be completely sure that no bit errors have occurred. This is because of the way the checksum of the packet is calculated. If the corresponding bits of two 16-bit words in the packet are 0 and 1, then even if these bits are flipped to 1 and 0, respectively, the sum remains unchanged. Therefore, the complement calculated by the receiver will also be the same. This means that the checksum will be verified even if there are transmission errors.
